# Notes
# The utilities below (re, hashlib, argparse, pathlib, etc.) are part of the
# Python standard library and should NOT be listed in requirements. They were
# removed to avoid pip attempting to install them.
#
# Some packages may not have wheels for the very latest Python versions (for
# example, early releases of Python 3.13). If you run into compatibility errors
# during installation, consider using Python 3.11 or a conda environment where

# prebuilt binaries are available.
